# Network Traffic Analysis Labs

## Focus
- Understand live network traffic
- Identify DNS, TCP, TLS, HTTPS flows
- Learn packet capture & filtering

## Tools
- Wireshark (Windows)
- Browser traffic (Edge, Google)

## Lab Status
- Capture: ✅ Completed
- Filters Applied: DNS, TLS
- Data Saved: .pcapng

## Key Observations
- DNS queries resolve domains like google.com, mtalk.google.com
- HTTPS traffic is encrypted (TLS handshake visible, payload hidden)
- Client Hello observed before encrypted application data


### Week 2 Update

#### What I Practiced & Studied
- Reviewed the OSI model and how data is encapsulated and decapsulated across layers
- Connected OSI theory to real network traffic previously captured in Wireshark
- Studied the CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) and its relevance to network security
- Reviewed common cyber attack types and their high-level impact
- Identified key tools to focus on as a beginner, including Wireshark and Splunk

#### What Clicked
- Encapsulation explains why multiple protocol headers appear in packet captures
- DNS resolution occurs before HTTPS communication begins
- TLS encrypts application-layer data before it is handed to TCP, providing confidentiality
- Even when payloads are encrypted, network metadata remains visible

#### Temporary Constraint
- Hands-on labs paused due to a hardware issue (charger failure)
- Continued learning through review, documentation, and reflection

#### Next Week Focus
- Resume live traffic capture in Wireshark
- Apply OSI layer mapping directly to observed packets
- Practice protocol-based filtering (DNS, TLS, HTTP/HTTPS)
- Begin introductory exposure to log analysis concepts (Splunk)
