# Network Traffic Analysis Labs

## Focus
- Understand live network traffic
- Identify DNS, TCP, TLS, HTTPS flows
- Learn packet capture & filtering

## Tools
- Wireshark (Windows)
- Browser traffic (Edge, Google)

## Lab Status
- Capture: ✅ Completed
- Filters Applied: DNS, TLS
- Data Saved: .pcapng

## Key Observations
- DNS queries resolve domains like google.com, mtalk.google.com
- HTTPS traffic is encrypted (TLS handshake visible, payload hidden)
- Client Hello observed before encrypted application data
